# Benchmarking-Spectral-ML-Methods
This project explores and comparea seven spectral methods for two dataset: Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) Data and 3k PBMC (Single-cell RNA sequencing data). The seven methods are: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Laplacian Eigenmap, Diffusion Map and Hessian LLE.
